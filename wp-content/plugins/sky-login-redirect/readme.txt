Redirect all users, specific users, or roles to the page they were reading prior to logging in or logging out or to a custom page. Features an awesome login page customizer.

== Description ==

Sky Login Redirect redirects your users on log in and log out to the page you set in the options. You can choose to redirect specific users, specific roles, set global custom redirects to a given location or redirect everyone to the page they were reading prior to logging in or logging out.

It detects if the login request points to the backend and can prevent login redirect loops (when the referring page is a login or register page).

The settings page allow you to configure everything related to login in WordPress:

*   redirect users when they log in or log out: redirect users or roles, set custom redirects and redirects to the previous page
*   customize the login page with a few clicks to match the colors and styles of your site: colors, background color or image, borders, alignment, button styles
*   set a custom logo for your login page
*   additional settings related to the login page
